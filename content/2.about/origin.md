Gencaster is the result of our research into augmented audio. It all started in 2017 with the idea of creating a dynamic audio walk that adapts its story every time the listener changes their walking direction (similar to CYOA books).  

In 2019, we finally produced our first proof of concept titled "Social Score - Nothing to Hide." It is a GPS-based audiobook spoken by an artificial voice which negotiates the possible introduction of a social scoring system in Germany. It runs for about 25 minutes and adapts the narrative to the listener and their respective environment in real time. It got nominated for the Online Grimme Award, as well as the Prix Europa (Best European Online Media Project of the Year) and also won the DOK.Digital Award.  

In 2022, Vinzenz and Dennis teamed up to combine their knowledge in real-time radiophonic experiences and generative live music and started developing Gencaster and its corresponding editor.  

The first alpha version will release by the summer of 2023. After that, we will start using it in production and continue to add improvements and extensions to the project. Further, a series of workshops are planned for 2023 to get radio play creators and musicians to try it out and provide feedback for improvements.  

We are always looking for collaborators, feedback or any other requests to continue gencasters journey. Please contact us via mail. Finally, many thanks to our supporters MIZ Babelsberg and Medialab Bayern.
