The editor is the control interface for gencaster. It allows anyone to create, manage and update their own dynamic audio experiences. The graph-based layout represents the logical connections between the different parts of the audio composition. Each node in turn contains the information needed to create the individual scenes. These can range from uploaded audio recordings to completely real-time generated content, allowing for a wide range of formats.  
We have focused on creating an editor that can be used without any specific coding experience. However, for those who want to take their creations to the next level, the node cells can be extended with code in different languages to increase complexity or add dynamic content, such as generated text, generative background music or special logic.
