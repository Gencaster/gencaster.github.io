text: Due to the low latency we can use the feedback of the listener immediately via interactions. These interactions can be based on the GPS location of the user, allowing not only for dynamic content but also for content that is suited for the listener. This interaction is not limited to numerical data but can also be the microphone of the listener, making it possible to analyze and modify the environmental sounds of the user.
