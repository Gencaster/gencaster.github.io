On 2023-10-04, at the end of our Media Lab Bayern fellowship, we were invited to present and demo Gencaster to invited partners in Munich.
We were grateful to show the progress we made during the months of the fellowship to an audience and get some feedback from experts in the industry.

We had some interesting conversations with people from different radio stations who suggested, for example, to use the possibility of tracking body movements to create a collaborative action.
