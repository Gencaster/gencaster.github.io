On 2023-05-06 Toplap Düsseldorf organized a satellite event of the ICLC 2023, where artists from Düsseldorf were asked to contribute to a live coding concert.

Dennis Scheiba, who is also a core developer of *Gencaster*, live coded Gencaster and the only way to listen to the performance was to access the website through a smartphone to obtain a stream.
Therefore each audience member became a loudspeaker which could move and also could adjust the volume of the speaker, creating a special kind of spatiality within the concert hall.

The sounds played through each of the smartphones were coded in real time on the laptop, and ranged from droning sine waves to the sound of a typewriter over to birds.
