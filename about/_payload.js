It all started in 2017 with the idea of creating a dynamic audio walk that adapts its story every time the listener changes their walking direction (similar to CYOA books).","Techstack","Our frontend is developed in Vue and communicates with our Django backend via GraphQL which allows us to query, modify and stream data in a dynamic but reliable manner.","After graduating in Visual Communication from the University of Applied Sciences Berlin, he co-founded the interactive design studio sansho and more recently ungroup.group. He is currently enrolled in the media arts department at the UdK Berlin and works as a media artist in the field of audio\u002Fvisual experiences. Vinzenz regularly participates in exhibitions, gives talks and lectures at universities.","Vinzenz Aubry","He studied mathematics in Cologne and worked as a data scientist at the broadcaster RTL where he developed a distributed video analyzing pipeline with AI tools and researched on the impact of audiovisual advertisement among other things. In 2019 he started to study music in Düsseldorf and has since become a composer with an emphasis on audio-visual electronic compositions.","Dennis Scheiba","Ralph","Ralph is a Berlin-based Swiss writer of South Indian descent working through text, performance and audio. His works have reaped multiple awards, such as the Alfred-Döblin Scholarship granted by the Academy of Arts Berlin, the writing scholarship by the Senat of Berlin and a nomination for the Grimme Online Award.
